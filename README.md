# Academia

<h3>**Title**</h3> Design and Development of Course Registration Portal (Academia).<br />
<h3>**Description**</h3> The project aims to develop a Academia Portal that is user-friendly and
multifunctional.<br />
The project should have the following functionalities:<br />
● All Student and Faculty details and Course information are stored in files.<br />
● Account holders have to pass through a login system to enter their accounts, and
all these User accounts will be managed by the Administrator.<br />
● Roles to implement: Faculty, Student, Admin.<br />
● The application should possess password-protected administrative access, thus
preventing the whole management system from unauthorized access.<br />
● Once the Admin connects to the server, He/She should get a login and
password prompt.<br/>
After successful login, He/She should get menu for example:<br />
Do you want to:
<ul>
  <li>Add Student</li>
  <li>Add Faculty</li>
  <li>Activate/Deactivate Student</li>
  <li>Update Student/Faculty details</li>
  <li>Exit</li>
</ul>

● Once the Student connects to the server, He/She should get a login and
password prompt.
After successful login, He/She should get menu for example:<br />
Do you want to: 
<ul>
  <li>Enroll to new Courses</li>
  <li>Unenroll from already enrolled Courses</li>
  <li>View enrolled Courses</li>
  <li>Password Change</li>
  <li>Exit</li>
</ul>

● Once the Faculty connects to the server, He/She should get a login and
password prompt.
After successful login, He/She should get menu  for example:<br />
Do you want to:
<ul>
  <li>Add new Course</li>
  <li>Remove offered Course</li>
  <li>View enrollments in Courses</li>
  <li>Password Change</li>
  <li>Exit</li>
</ul>

(Assumption: Course will have a limited number of seats.)
