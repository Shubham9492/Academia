<h3>**Title**</h3>: Design and Development of Course Registration Portal (Academia).<br />
<h3>**Description**</h3>: The project aims to develop a Academia Portal that is user-friendly and
multifunctional.<br />
The project should have the following functionalities:<br />
● All Student and Faculty details and Course information are stored in files.<br />
● Account holders have to pass through a login system to enter their accounts, and
all these User accounts will be managed by the Administrator.<br />
● Roles to implement: Faculty, Student, Admin.<br />
● The application should possess password-protected administrative access, thus
preventing the whole management system from unauthorized access.<br />
● Once the Admin connects to the server, He/She should get a login and
password prompt.<br/>
After successful login, He/She should get menu for example:<br />
Do you want to:
 - Add Student
 - Add Faculty
 - Activate/Deactivate Student
 - Update Student/Faculty details
 - Exit<br />

● Once the Student connects to the server, He/She should get a login and
password prompt.
After successful login, He/She should get menu for example:<br />
Do you want to: 
 - Enroll to new Courses
 - Unenroll from already enrolled Courses
 - View enrolled Courses
 - Password Change
 - Exit <br />

● Once the Faculty connects to the server, He/She should get a login and
password prompt.
After successful login, He/She should get menu  for example:<br />
Do you want to:
 - Add new Course
 - Remove offered Course
 - View enrollments in Courses
 - Password Change
 - Exit<br />
(Assumption: Course will have a limited number of seats.)
